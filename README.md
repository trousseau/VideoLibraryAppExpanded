# VideoLibraryAppExpanded
An expanded version of the ASP MVC best of Robert Deniro Video Library application that was my final project for an ASP MVC class. Business logic is primarily written in C# using MVC conventions. Additional elements such as autocomplete were built using jQuery and AJAX. The application also relies on calls to the Movie Database API to populate information after consuming JSON response.  

To run:
